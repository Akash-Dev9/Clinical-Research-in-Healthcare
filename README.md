#Article Description:
#When a person gets ill and visits a hospital, there are two common questions that are posed in
#front of the person:
-1. What has happened to me?
-2. How does my future look like?

While the first question refers to the diagnosis of the current situation to know the illness, the
second is about predicting future medical risks. Exploring the answer to the first question is
easy due to the availability of a broad spectrum of diagnostic tools today. The technology is
much less advanced today to provide answers to the second question. Traditionally, this
question about medical risk is answered only by experienced clinicians. 

The challenge that the Healthcare industry is facing today, is that the experienced specialists
are highly expensive and have limited availability. This is where modern Electronic Health
Records (EHRs) bring a ray of hope as they promise to offer a fast and cheap alternative.

Typically, an EHR contains the history about the patient, hospital encounters, diagnoses and
interventions, lab tests, and clinical narratives. The full adoption of EHRs has led to intensified
research in building predictive models from this rich data source in the past few years.
Data Science facilitates building of such predictive models on patient-level temporal healthcare
data. These models must address four open challenges:
• Long-term dependencies on healthcare. For instance, the onset of diabetes at middle age
remains a risk factor for the rest of the life
• Representation of admission: The admission data is complex and consists of information
related to diagnoses, interventions, and other such details.
• Medical records varying significantly in length are inherently episodic and irregular
• Medical records are a blend of the course of illness, intervening, and the developmental
processes

In addition to addressing these four challenges, a predictive system is expected to comprehend
medical records, determine present illness states, and predict future outcomes based on the
data at hand.
